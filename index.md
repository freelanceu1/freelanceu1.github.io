In fact, one student Julie shared… 
> “My experience at FreeU has exceeded my expectations. It has provided me with not only the skills I need to do client work but also a community of people who are helpful, knowledgeable, and welcoming. I initially thought that I would just join for a few months as I set up and started my business.

I consider this membership one of the most important tools in my VA toolbox!”
