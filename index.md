<blockquote style="font-family:montserrat;">“My experience at FreeU has exceeded my expectations. It has provided me with not only the skills I need to do client work but also a community of people who are helpful, knowledgeable, and welcoming. I initially thought that I would just join for a few months as I set up and started my business. However, I know now that the (always updated and relevant) coursework and information will provide ongoing education that is beneficial for both me and my clients. I consider this membership one of the most important tools in my VA toolbox!”</blockquote>
